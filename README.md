# InSe


DP model for single-layer InSe system.

- `model.pb`, DP model trained for FPGA, which is suitable for nvnmd simulation

- `set-train`, dataset for single-layer InSe sytem

- `nvnmd-train`, input script to train DP model for fpga (nvnmd)

- `dp-train`, input script to train a common DP model for cpu (traditional dpmd)
